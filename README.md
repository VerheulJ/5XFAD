The information is compartmentalized into three separate locations:

The script utilized in QIIME2 can be found in the file named QIIME2-2023.5. This script is specifically designed for data processing and 
analysis within the QIIME2 environment.

The script responsible for conducting statistical analysis in the R programming language is stored within the file titled Rstats. 
This script is tailored to perform statistical calculations and generate meaningful insights from the data.

The resultant spreadsheets generated as part of the analysis are contained within the compressed file named 5xfad.zip. 
This compressed file houses multiple files, each serving a specific purpose and containing valuable information related to the analysis.

The compressed file encompasses pertinent metadata, which are as follows:

    The file "efecto_genotype.xlsx" contains multiple sheets, each representing a taxonomic level. 
    These sheets include columns for the mean relative abundance of the three studied genotypes, columns for the mean relative abundances 
    of each individual genotype, and another column for the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test conducted between all OTU samples.

    The file "Significativo_genotype.xlsx" includes the OTUs from the "efecto_genotype" file with a p-value greater than 0.05, 
    indicating significant differences.

    Similarly, the file "efecto_age.xlsx" consists of sheets for each taxonomic level, with columns representing the mean relative abundance 
    for the two studied age groups, columns for the mean relative abundances of each individual age group, and another column for the 
    Mann-Whitney U test conducted between all OTU samples.

    The file "Significativo_age.xlsx" contains the OTUs from the "efecto_age" file with a p-value greater than 0.05, indicating significant differences.

    The file "efecto_gender.xlsx" follows a similar structure, with sheets for each taxonomic level, columns for the mean relative abundance 
    for the two studied genders, columns for the mean relative abundances of each individual gender, and another column for the Mann-Whitney
    U test conducted between all OTU samples.

    The file "Significativo_gender.xlsx" includes the OTUs from the "efecto_gender" file with a p-value greater than 0.05, 
    indicating significant differences.

    The files "Lecturas_*.xlsx" contain the sequencing reads for each sample, categorized by the respective taxonomic levels.

    The file "Abundancia.xlsx" comprises multiple sheets, each representing a taxonomic level, and containing the relative abundances of all samples.

    The file "estadistica.xlsx" includes the results of U-Mann Whitney tests conducted for each genotype, comparing it pairwise to another genotype 
    for all possible combinations. These tests are aimed at determining statistical differences between genotypes.

    The file "efecto_genotipo_entre_edades.xlsx" contains a statistical test that compares the abundance of each genotype segregated by age. 
    It examines the differences in abundances for each genotype between young individuals and adults, with separate sheets for each comparison.

    The file "efecto_genotipo_edad.xlsx" focuses on studying the changes that occur over months in carriers and healthy mice. 
    It specifically compares the differences between young adults and adults for each genotype, providing insights into 
    the variations based on age groups.
